# This is a test

This repo is here to test how forking behaves on Github, with issues like issue mentions.

This also demonstrates a pull request, in the context of rebases.

Look at how the [issue](https://github.com/dbramucci/github-test-forking-upstream/issues/1) keeps getting pinged by the same commit message and patch.
The only thing that changes is the unrelated `README.md` file, which isn't easy to navigate to.

Also, here's the [pull request](https://github.com/dbramucci/github-test-forking-upstream/pull/2) which get's more filler and "dead end commits" as time goes on.
Strangely, it appears that the repeating push messages in the pull request only show up while my browser window is open.
When I open it again, they've disappeared.

That really appears to be the case.
When I refresh the page, the old commits disappear.
